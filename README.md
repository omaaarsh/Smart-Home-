🌟 **Excited to Share My Latest Embedded Systems Project: Smart Home Automation** 🌟

I am thrilled to announce the completion of my **Smart Home Automation System** project, showcasing the power of embedded systems in modernizing home environments. This project integrates sensor-based automation, ensuring comfort, energy efficiency, and enhanced safety. 🏠✨

### 🔑 **Project Highlights:**
My smart home system is powered by the **ATmega32 microcontroller** and designed to seamlessly manage key home functions:
- **Automatic Lighting Control** based on ambient light levels, using an LDR sensor and RGB LEDs.
- **Temperature-Based Fan Control** with adaptive speed levels powered by an LM35 temperature sensor.
- **Real-Time Fire Detection** using a flame sensor, triggering a safety alert system.
- **Intuitive User Interface** via an LCD display, providing real-time feedback on system status, temperature, and light intensity.

### 🛠️ **Technical Overview:**
**Here’s a breakdown of the drivers and logic powering the system:**

- **LDR Sensor (Light Intensity Control):**  
  Monitors ambient light using ADC on channel 0. The system dynamically adjusts RGB LEDs based on light intensity for optimal room lighting.

- **LED Driver:**  
  Controls the red, green, and blue LEDs with flexible configuration and logic to match the environmental lighting conditions.

- **LM35 Temperature Sensor (Fan Control):**  
  Reads temperature data, allowing the system to adjust the fan’s speed across four modes: Off, Low, Medium, and High, ensuring energy-efficient cooling.

- **Flame Sensor (Fire Detection):**  
  Continuously monitors for fire hazards. Upon detection, it triggers an audible buzzer alert until the danger is resolved.

- **DC Motor Driver (Fan):**  
  PWM-based fan speed control, offering precision with different speed levels depending on the room temperature.

- **Buzzer Alert System:**  
  Engages in critical situations (fire detection), warning users with a loud and continuous alarm.

- **LCD Display:**  
  Provides real-time updates on temperature, light intensity, and system statuses to the user for clear monitoring.

### 💡 **How the System Works:**
- **Lighting Adjustment:**  
  The LDR sensor measures light intensity, activating or deactivating the RGB LEDs based on predefined light thresholds.
  
- **Fan Speed Control:**  
  The system monitors temperature data and adjusts the fan speed accordingly, ensuring the room is always at a comfortable temperature.

- **Fire Detection:**  
  The flame sensor ensures safety by detecting fire hazards and triggering an immediate buzzer alarm, alerting users to any danger.

- **User Feedback:**  
  The LCD interface allows users to see real-time data on temperature and lighting conditions, ensuring intuitive control over the home environment.
